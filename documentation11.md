## Project 11 Documentation
---
### We launched the following instances:

#### 3 RHEL Instances

* Webserver-1
*  Webserver-2
* NFS

#### 3 Ubuntu Instances

* LB
* DB
* Jenkins-Ansible



---
## Then I installed and configured Ansible and Jenkins on the Jenkins-Ansible server
---

#### Update the jenkins server 
```
sudo apt update
```
#### Install the Java Development Kit and dependencies 
```
sudo apt install default-jdk-headless
```

#### Install Jenkins
```
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > \
    /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'

sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
```
#### Jenkins successfully installed

![Jenkins Installed](./images/jenkins-installed.JPG)
```
sudo systemctl status jenkins
```

#### Next I opened port 8080 inthe Jenkins-Ansible security group as it is the port that Jenkins uses.  




![Jenkins port 8080](./images/jenkins-sg.JPG)

Next I loaded the jenkins page in the web browser
http://18.134.3.98:8080        



![Jenkins browser](./images/password.JPG)  

Next, I got the password from /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword and set up Jenkins on the web browser        




![Jenkins browser](./images/unlock-jenkins2.JPG)    


```
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

---
## Install and configure Ansible on the Ansible-Jenkins Instance/Server
---

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible -y
```

### Check ansible version  
```
ansible --version
```

![Ansible version](./images/ansible-version.JPG)  







## The next step was to customize Jenkins. I selected the Install suggested plugins option  
---  


![Jenkins plugins](./images/jenkins-plugins2.JPG)  

---
## The next step was to configure Jenkins to retrieve source codes from GitHub using Webhooks
---  

### I created a github repository called project-ansible  

### I enabled webhook in the github repository settings

![Jenkins build](./images/github-webhook.JPG)

### created a freestyle project called ansible in Jenkins

### In configuration of the Jenkins freestyle project (Ansible) , I choose Git repository

### I then entered the url of my git repository

### I changed the branch to build from master to main

### I saved and ran the build which was successful  

![Jenkins build](./images/jenkins-build.JPG)


### The next step was to configure Jenkins so that the build is automated - triggered from a github webhook  




### I selected the GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling option checkbox  


![Jenkins build](./images/build-triggers.JPG)


### I then set the post build actions to archive the artifacts

![Jenkins build](./images/archive-artifacts.JPG)

### The next step was to push changes from VS Code to Github and see if build #4 will be triggered by the webhook

![Jenkins build](./images/updated-code.JPG)

![Jenkins build](./images/build4.JPG)

### I proceeded to check if the artifacts of build #4 were stored on the jenkins server at /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/4/archive/

```
ls /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/4/archive/
```
![Jenkins build](./images/artifacts.JPG)  


### The artifacts were successfully stored on the  Jenkins server  

### end of jenkins configuration  

##Next is to create a new branch testbranch  to our repository 

```
git branch

git status

git checkout -b testbranch
```

### I created the directory structure aand files 
playbooks
 - common.yml
inventory
 - dev.yml   
 - staging.yml   
 - uat.yml  
 - prod.yml  

```
mkdir playbooks && touch playbooks/common.yml

mkdir inventory && touch inventory/dev.yml inventory/staging.yml inventory/uat.yml inventory/prod.yml
```

### I updated the inventory/dev.yml file with the code snippet below
```
[nfs]
172.31.2.41 ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user'

[webservers]
172.31.12.97 ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user'
172.31.6.178 ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user'

[db]
172.31.15.148 ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user' 

[lb]
172.31.9.227 ansible_ssh_user='ubuntu'
```

The next step was to set up ssh agent

```
eval `ssh-agent -s`

```
ssh-add path-to-private-key
```
ssh-add PBL.pem
```
### ssh -A ubuntu@ instance-public-ip-addess
```
ssh -A ubuntu@18.132.200.175
```
### persist key on server

```
ssh-add -l
```
![persist key](./images/persist-key.JPG)


## In playbooks/common.yml playbook,  I updated it with the following code containing the configuration for repeatable, re-usable, and multi-machine tasks that is common to systems within the infrastructure.



```
---
- name: update web, nfs and db servers
  hosts: webservers, nfs, db
  remote_user: ec2-user
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
    - name: ensure wireshark is at the latest version
      yum:
        name: wireshark
        state: latest

- name: update LB server
  hosts: lb
  remote_user: ubuntu
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt repo
      apt: 
        update_cache: yes

    - name: ensure wireshark is at the latest version
      apt:
        name: wireshark
        state: latest

```

### Next step was to push all changes in branch testbranch to the githup repository

```
git add .

git commit -m "updated playbook and inventory files"

git push origin testbranch
```
### Next I created a pull request on github

![pull request](./images/create-pull-request.JPG)  

### I merged the changes in testbranch to main

![merged branches](./images/merge-pull-request.JPG) 

Then I closed the pull request after merging

![merged branches](./images/merged-and-closed.JPG) 

### I proceeded to check that the build was automatically triggered in Jenkins  

![merged branches](./images/merge-files-jenkins.JPG) 

### I also checked that jenkins had saved the artifacts on the server (build #10)
### at /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/10/archive/

```
ls /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/10/archive/

```


![artifacts10](./images/archived-artifacts10.JPG) 

## Run first ansible test
---

### I connect to the host using remote SSH

ssh - A ubuntu@18.132.200.175

### successfully connected remotel to server

### open folders on server

### run playbook on build #10
```
ansible-playbook -i  /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/10/archive/inventory/dev.yml /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/10/archive/playbooks/common.yml   
```


![run playbook](./images/playbook-successful.JPG) 


### I did an SSH into the other instances to confirm that wireshark was successfully installed.
### Webserver 1

![webserver1](./images/wireshark1.JPG)  

### Webserver 2

![webserver1](./images/wireshark2.JPG)

### Next, I added new instructions to the playbook common.yml to create a directory called sample and 
### create a file called ansible.txt

### I added the code snippet below to the existing common.yml

```
- name: create directory, file ans set timezone on all servers
  hosts: webservers, nfs, db, lb
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: create a directory
      file:
        path: /home/sample
        state: directory
   
    - name: create a file
      file:
        path: /home/sample/ansible.txt
        state: touch

    - name: change timezone
      timezone:
        name: Africa/Lagos

```
---

![webserver1](./images/ansiblesuccess.JPG)

### I then checked to see if the new instructions had executed successfully and creted the folder and file

# End of Project 11. 12 will be on the same github repository.
